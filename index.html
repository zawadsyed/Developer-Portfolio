            <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                work.
                <br>
                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development

                <p>Currently I'm working as a UI/UX Designer. Since they didn't offer me a job as a developer, <br>I
                    made
                    a contribution as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed it to them. <br>They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
                    Hero.
